#import numpy


# bmi_dict = {
#        float(18.5): "Underweight",
#
# }
# print(type(bmi_dict[18.5]))



# returns the key as a str
# <class 'str'>

# yet I can perform comparisons as if it were an int
# why is that?


# bmi = bmi_dict[int(18.5)]
# my_bmi = 17
# if my_bmi <= bmi_dict[int(18.5)]:
#     print(bmi_dict[18.5])
